ELL-i-Eagle-Libraries
=====================

We at the ELL-i open source co-operative have decided to adopt the
SpartFun Electronics' Eagle approach to Eagle models, with the
addition of providing EagleUp models for all the components that we
have in our libraries.  In the cases where there is already an
existing SparkFun component that we use, we only provide the
corresponding EagleUp models in this repository.
